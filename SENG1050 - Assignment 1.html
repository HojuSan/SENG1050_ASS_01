          The objectives of this assignment are to test your ability to create
          XML documents that contain well-defined information and to develop web pages using HTML with CSS. This assignment will
          be developed further in Assignment 2.

        <p>
Producers of the reality TV show ChefMaster wish to establish a website highlighting all the recipes featuring on the show. The recipes should include a list of ingredients, only one of which should be a “main ingredient” as well as instructions for preparation. In order to assist people searching the recipes, the producers want to include some attributes of each entry.</p>

<p> With this in mind, the producers have invited you, as a promising student of the University of Newcastle with web communication skills, to develop a web site, <em>ChefMaster Recipes</em>. They would like you to construct a prototype of the web page to be launched. In particular they would like you to choose TWO of the category of recipes as mentioned below and, for each, provide a page listing THREE recipes. That means that, if you choose Asian Cuisine (or vegetarian or other) as a category, your page should list THREE Asian (or vegetarian or other) recipes. </p>
<p>
Note: You can make up your own categories, say diabetic (recipes for people with diabetes), or pizza (pizza recipes).<br>
Also, these need not be real recipes - feel free to make up your own. I am not going to try them.
		
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			Your task is to present these recipes as appealingly as possible on the web. 
			This will involve, </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Creating an <a href="https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-4486841-dt-content-rid-23581687_1/courses/CRS.129864.2020.S1/Assignment1_2020.html#template">XML template</a> and <a href="https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-4486841-dt-content-rid-23581687_1/courses/CRS.129864.2020.S1/Assignment1_2020.html#dtd">DTD</a> </li>
          <li>Creating two <a href="https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-4486841-dt-content-rid-23581687_1/courses/CRS.129864.2020.S1/Assignment1_2020.html#objects">XML documents</a></li>
          <li>Developing <a href="https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-4486841-dt-content-rid-23581687_1/courses/CRS.129864.2020.S1/Assignment1_2020.html#web">a home page</a> for the advertisement.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Details of all these requirements are given below.
        </p>

        <hr>

		<h2 id="template">XML template</h2>
        <p>
			The template will be a <strong>valid</strong> XML file. The important parts here are the tags
			(the organization of the data), <strong>not the actual data</strong> about any recipe. 
			However, you may need to include some arbitrary data to allow your page to be validated. 
			For example, if the <em>default</em> of an attribute is #REQUIRED, 
			the attribute needs a value otherwise it will not be validated.
		</p>

        <h3> XML Specification</h3>
        <p>
As the ChefMaster series is shown round the globe the producers want to collect new recipes and display them on the site. They will not know what categories they might need until they collect some recipes. For example, they may not need a category for “insect based dishes” until they encounter a culture that consumes insects. So the producers’ IT team, responsible for page updating and maintenance, will need an XML template that they can copy and use for all new fields and dishes. The template will be used for your example dishes described below.</p><p>
			The document should be able to store as many recipes as required within a given category. 
			
			You will decide the tags that you wish to use to describe the recipe, 
			but, for each recipe, you should at least have tags for the following items …. 
		</p> 

			<ul>
        <li>Something that tells us the country of origin of the dish</li>
        <li>Supports at least 1 recipe</li>
        <li>Each recipe needs to have at least...
          <ul>
          <li>A list of ingredients</li>
          <li>Preparation instructions</li>
          <li>Person who composed the recipe</li>
		<li> How long the dish takes to prepare</li>
		<li>	How many people the recipe serves</li>
          <li>Link or links to websites that have information on the main ingredient(s)</li>
          <li>Some properties, that you can choose, such as safe for diabetics, vegan, halal ...</li>
          <li>The filename of the image of the main ingredient (more info about this later on)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        
		<p>
			At least 1 tag must have an attribute. If you  include only the items mentioned above you will 
			<strong>NOT</strong> get full marks for the assignment. Please add at least 2 more tags that 
			make your template different from others.
		</p>
		
        <hr>

        <h2 id="dtd">DTD</h2>

        <p>
          You will also need to write a DTD for your XML. Generally, it is your choice whether the DTD 
		  is internal or external, however, for the SENG1050 assignment, you should make 
		  the DTD internal because it is easier to validate your XML and DTD. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Your DTD will need to describe all the tags and attributes that you used in your XML. 
		  It will also be important to use optional modifiers (+, *, ?) to indicate how many 
		  instances of each tag are allowed. 
        </p>
		<p>
			In your DTD, define at least one entity (&lt;!ENTITY&gt;) and use it in the XML document.
		</p>


        <hr>
		<h2 id="objects">XML documents</h2>

        <p>
          Once you have your XML template with DTD, you will need to make 2 separate XML documents.
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Choose two categories and</li>
			<li> write one XML document for each category.</li>
			<li> Each XML document should contain <strong>data</strong> for 3 recipes.</li>
			<li> each XML document should contain the internal DTD at the top of the document.</li>
			<li> the DTDs in 2 XML documents should be the same.</li>
			<li> the 2 XML documents <strong>MUST</strong> have the same tags and DTD as the XML template.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<hr>
		
	<h2 id="web">Homepage development</h2>
		<p>
		You will develop the <em>ChefMaster</em> Homepage. You need to create the following files:<br><be>
	
		</be></p><ul>
		<li><a href="https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-4486841-dt-content-rid-23581687_1/courses/CRS.129864.2020.S1/Assignment1_2020.html#all">Homepage (index.html)</a></li>

          <h3 id="plagiarism">Warning - Plagiarism</h3>
         <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as
            <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it was your own</dfn>.
            This includes the copying of content from other people's
            Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing"
            (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been
            copied and where they were copied from).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you "quote" other people's work in your assignments, then
            you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately.
            Failure to do so will cause you to lose marks for the assignment.
            An assignment that consists largely of work copied from elsewhere
            will receive very low (zero) marks, and may be reported to the
            School for suspicion of plagiarism.

          To submit your files, place them all into a single
          <span class="file"><strong>.zip</strong></span> archive containing every file and
          submit it using the Web form in the Assignment 1 area.
          The <span class="file">.zip</span> archive should be named
          <span class="file">cXXXXXXX.zip</span> archive where

          <strong>your</strong> student id.
